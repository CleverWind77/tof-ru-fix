# tof-ru-fix
Fix of Russian Localization file for Tower of Fantasy

Author: CleverWind

# Can you get banned?
Yes and No.
Yes - by using unofficial files, which mods ARE, you're breaking EULA and TOS of the game, and putting your account at risk.
No - there were barely any accidents of people banned for using safe for game mods(like retextures, fixes. etc.)
In any case, using this patch is YOUR choice and YOU will take responsibility for that.

# How to install?
Go on Releases page, and download zip archive. Install as usual mods, by extracting files from archive to path:
Game_Folder\Client\WindowsNoEditor\Hotta\Content\PatchPaks(if no folder - create it)

# On what fixes affects?
- Descriptions of gamemodes, settings, menu
- Most of the story and NPC textlines
- Incorrect or early line ending in dialogues

# What exactly changes?
- Fixed misgendering(wrong pronouns) to MC or other characters.
- Most of dialogeus changed to be gender-neutral for MC
- Changed multiple formal "You" in informal "You" when used for MC or characters-friends. Formal "You" is still used if appropriate: For strangers(for a while), high authorities, etc.
- Fixed wrong traslations for: Gikros(Гикрос) changed to Hykros(Хайкрос), Bygone Phantom(Фантом Прошлого) changed to Bygone Phantasm(Фантазм Прошлого), Lin'(Линь) changed to Lin(Лин), etc.
- Correct usage of terms: Authoriser as Authoriser(Авторизатор), insted of different usage of Authorized(adverb)(Уполномоченный), Administrator(Администратор), etc.
- Unifed text coloring: now like in current versions, all 3rd person actions/emotions are purple color, and important terms are blue.
- Minor fixes.

# How often to redownload/update mod?
I can't say yet if the mod will be compatible with future versions. Probably after an update, mod needs to be uninstalled until I release update.

# How long to wait for mod update?
It depends of amount of added text. Bigger the update - longer it will take. Plus I need to complete patch with two MCs(male and female), and make changes. And I also doing it in my free time from job, so expect it to be from 5 to 12 days.

# There's a not-fixed mistake!!!
I REALLY NEED an information about those. Localization files is about 250k+ lines and noticing every mistake is impossible. That's why I need your help. Open "Issues" tab and fill an issue according to Template. I'll try to fix it ASAP, if it's possible.
